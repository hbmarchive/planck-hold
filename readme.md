# Hannah's OLKB Planck Hold Layout

This OLKB Planck layout is a distant cousin of the 34-key layout I initially
used when I first got my Ferris Sweep. Broadly speaking, it treats the Planck as
a 34-key keyboard and uses the additional keys for extras. I am using it to test
out a potential 42-key layout for a Cantor-style keyboard.

There are additional layer keys available to access function keys and shortcuts
although, in the case of the shortcuts, they may be honed to my individual
workflow and rely on AutoHotkey bindings. I have included a copy of my
AutoHotkey script for information.

### Credit

As ever, I want to give credit and thanks to [Ben
Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/benvallack) for talking through his
tap-not-hold approach and for all of his inspirational work on ergonomic
keyboards and layouts. My initial layout drew heavily from his [Ferris Sweep
layout](https://github.com/benvallack/34-QMK-Ferris-Sweep).

The contributers who make QMK possible are an incredible bunch of people and the
ErgoMechKeyboard community as a whole has been welcoming and helpful. Please
support open source projects and communities.
