# Hannah's OLKB Planck Layout

 This OLKB Planck layout is a modification of the 34-key layout I use on my
Ferris Sweep. It treats the Planck as a 34-key keyboard and uses the additional
keys for extras.

Broadly speaking, the layout is designed so that keys and modifiers are tapped
rather than held down. In place of the homerow modifiers this Planck version has
additional modifier keys mapped as one shot modifiers.

There are additional layer keys available to access function keys and shortcuts
although, in the case of the shortcuts, they may be honed to my individual
workflow and rely on AutoHotkey bindings. I have included a copy of my
AutoHotkey script for information.

### Credit

I want to give full credit and a massive amount of thanks to [Ben
Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/benvallack) for talking through his
tap-not-hold approach and for all of his inspirational work on ergonomic
keyboards and layouts. My initial layout drew heavily from his [Ferris Sweep
layout](https://github.com/benvallack/34-QMK-Ferris-Sweep).

The contributers who make QMK possible are an incredible bunch of people and the
ErgoMechKeyboard community as a whole has been welcoming and helpful. Please
support open source projects and communities, folks.

## Layer Navigation

The layer navigation keys are designed so that you can move between layers in a
predictable way without having to know which layer you are currently in.

**To get to the base layer** tap the *right thumb key* followed by the *left thumb key*.

**To get to the shortcut layer** tap the *forward slash key* once.

Note that you can get a forward slash character by typing the *forward slash
key* twice. To get a question mark character, press the `Shift` key first.

**To get to the number layer** tap the *right thumb key* twice.

**To get to the function layer** tap the *bottom left key*.

**To get to the symbol layer** tap the *right*, *left* then *right thumb key*.
